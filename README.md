    <h2>I'm a Fullstack Web Developer</h2>
    <p>
      Web technology is one of my passions I enjoy working in creative industries such as
      UI design or front-end development, and back-end, blockchain development is also an option. 
      <br />
      The majority of my work is done in a JavaScript environment.
